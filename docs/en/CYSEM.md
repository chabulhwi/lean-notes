## Redefining CYSEM

I wrote a [document][rdf] about how to revise the definition of child or youth
sexual exploitation material (CYSEM) in my Git repository called
[`talks`][talks].

Here are the changes I made to the definition:

(a) I clarified that CYSEM doesn't include written text.
(b) I included printed media in CYSEM that uses real minors. However, CYSEM
    depicting cartoon characters still doesn't include printed matter.
(c) I explicitly stated that CYSEM that uses fictional characters lacks serious
    literary, artistic, ideological, scientific, medical, or educational value.

Here, I present a formalization of the following arguments I made:

1. Virtual CYSEM, which only uses adults or fictional characters, is *by
   definition* obscene. Therefore, it lacks any value.
2. The current definition of CYSEM is logically equivalent to my definition,
   where it is defined as (a) real CYSEM or (b) virtual CYSEM that lacks any
   value.

I also formally stated my conjecture about a visual depiction of a child or
youth doing a sexual act: there's no such depiction that isn't obscene.

## Some important premises of my arguments

Below are some important premises of my arguments.

1. Virtual CYSEM is CYSEM.
2. CYSEM is equivalent to child or youth pornography (CYP).
3. CYP is pornography.
4. Pornography is obscene.
5. Any obscene material lacks any value.

I formalized each of these premises as follows:

1. `isCYSEM_of_isVirtualCYSEM {d : D} (h : IsVirtualCYSEM d) : IsCYSEM d`
2. `isCYSEM_iff_isCYP {d : D} : IsCYSEM d â†” IsCYP d`
3. `isPorn_of_isCYP {d : D} (h : IsCYP d) : IsPorn d`
4. `isObscene_of_isPorn {d : D} (h : IsPorn d) : IsObscene d`
5. `lacksValue_of_isObscene {d : D} (h : IsObscene d) : LacksValue d`

These theorems are contained in the `Depiction` namespace.
